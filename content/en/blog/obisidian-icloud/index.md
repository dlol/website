*Literally do not pay for Obsidian??*

I started college and I needed a note taking app, because I bought a MacBook I thought that Apple Notes would be okay, but I also have a PC and using Apple Notes on a PC is actually awful.

I also don't want to pay for Obsidian to give me a miserable 5(?) Gbs **NOPE it's only 1 Gb! (for $4/month/year!)** of storage, oh and I also like code fences which I don't think Apple Notes has.

### Tutorial

Install Obsidian first on your iPhone and create a new Vault choosing iCloud. It will create a folder called `<ICLOUD>/Obsidian/<vault-name>`. We won't use this though, because I already have a Vault, the reason why I did this was to make sure that these folders would be generated in the first place.

Okay now download iCloud on Windows and paste your Vault inside `<ICLOUD>/Obsidian/`, or do it in a Mac, it already has iCloud integrated.

How do I mount my iCloud on Linux? I don't know I don't use Linux on the desktop I don't think Apple gives API access to iCloud anyway, `rclone` doesn't have an option for iCloud so you're most likely borked.

> **Warning: Before Opening**

>Before starting to edit or pasting the vault inside /Obsidian inside iCloud, wait for other files to sync first, **ESPECIALLY** on Windows because Apple treats PC users like garbage. 

Now open the vault on Obsidian on your iPhone, Mac or PC!
