Hi, my name is Diogo and my nickname is "dw" or "diowo" or many others... I like making websites, archiving and self-hosting. For this, I learned a lot about Linux and other UNIX-Like OSes. I currently use Arch Linux on my ThinkPad for tinkering, Windows 11 on my PC and macOS on my MacBook.

I also currently have 3 servers running 24/7, including 2 at home: a Raspberry Pi 3 and my HomeLab and this VPS at *[kyun.host](https://kyun.host)* all running Debian GNU/Linux.

### contact

You can send me an email, I don't get emails often so I'll probably read it quickly
